Things I did

1. Move around ERD
2. added voter Info table
	- voterDataFeed to connect to voter info instead of person
	- deleted voter and voterRegistered table
3. added person_id to address table to link to a person's address
4. added country table
5. deleted duplicate tables in catalog tree
6. changed neighborhoods to geographicalBoundaries because not all neighborhoods could be in a district. (like part of a neighbrohood can belong to 2 different districts because of gerrymandering)
	- deleted city id because geographical boundaries can go across city lines
	- geoboundary table will reference street table to ensure that the address matches the stree that is within its boundaries
7. created table that holds streets within a geographical boundary
	-also created a lookup table for street_type
8. created term_limit lookup table
9. deleted FK for candidate to district because it can be found based on what position the candidate ran for and what office they held
	- cadndiates can run to different office position & also it was very difficult for the erd to not cross lines 
10. added voter status lookup


needs discussion?
1. combined ballot and voter ballot table
2. deleted contest table
3. changed district_id in office_held to election_id so we can see when the election was for the specific office and it can also link the district to the office via election table
4. took out foreign key for voter_data_feed table because all we need is voter_ballot_id to distribute all the data
